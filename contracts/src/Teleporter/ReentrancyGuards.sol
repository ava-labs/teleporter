/**
 * @dev Abstract contract that helps implement reentrancy guards between functions for sending and receiving.
 *
 * Consecutive calls for sending functions should work together, same for receive functions, but recursive calls
 * should be detected as a reentrancy and revert.
 *
 * Calls between send and receive functions should also be allowed, but not in the case it ends up being a recursive
 * send or receive call. For example the following should fail: send -> receive -> send.
