Description: Provides a validator's uptime for calculating staking rewards (`PoSSecurityModule` only)

Signed by: L1

Consumed by: Validator Manager Contract

Specification:

|          Field |       Type |     Size |
| -------------: | ---------: | -------: |
|      `codecID` |   `uint16` |  2 bytes |
|       `typeID` |   `uint32` |  4 bytes |
| `validationID` | `[32]byte` | 32 bytes |
|       `uptime` |   `uint64` |   8 byte |
|                |            | 46 bytes |

This is defined within `Subnet-EVM` [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/blob/323eb0c7dd7204521e662a3a355fe78a0e19c0be/warp/messages/validator_uptime.go#L14-L19). The `ValidationUptimeMessage` must be included as an `AddressedPayload` with the `sourceAddress` set to an empty byte array, to prove that it did not originate as an arbitrary on-chain message. The `sourceChainID` must match the `uptimeBlockchainID` used to initialize the `PoSSecurityModule`. `uptimeBlockchainID` must be validated by the L1 validator set managed by the `PoSSecurityModule`.
